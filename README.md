# SteelSpotter
 🏀🏈⚽🏒 Ticket Scraper for Pittsburgh Sports Fans 🎫🎟️

Our app, SteelSpotter, provides ticket prices and games information for all Pittsburgh sports
fans. We scraped the data of Panthers men’s basketball games and Steelers’ football games
from SeatGeek and StubHub. All the data displayed in our application were pre-scraped on Dec
4th, 2024. However, users can still access the latest game and ticket information through online
web-scraping and download the data as files by themselves. Additionally, SteelSpotter provides
features for users to browse local hotels and explore statistics of their favorite teams and
players, creating a seamless and informative experience for sports enthusiasts.
